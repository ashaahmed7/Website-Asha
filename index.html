<h2>Geography</h2>
Somalia is in the <strong><em>"Horn of Africa"</em></strong> and has the longest coastline in mainland Africa on the most eastern part of the continent. Somalia's capital is <strong>Mogadishu.</strong>
<p> The <em>Gulf of Aden</em> lies to the north, and the <em>Indian Ocean</em> lies to the east. On land, Somalia borders <em>Djibouti, Ethiopia,</em> and <em>Kenya.</em></p>
<p>Somalia is one of the world’s hottest countries. The southwest and the northwest receive more rain than the northeast, which is very dry. Somalia's landscapes include deserts, mountains, and beaches, and it's a major producer of frankincense, fish and bananas.

<h2>People</h2>
Somalia is home to about 18 million people. Somali and Arabic are the national languages. Some people also speak English or Italian. The Somali language did not have a written form until 1973.
<p> More than half of Somalia’s people are nomads, or people who move from place to place while raising livestock. They raise animals like:
<ul> Goats</ul>
<ul> Sheep</ul>
<ul> Camels,</ul>
<ul>and Cattle.</ul>
</p>
<p> The Somalis are divided into many clans, or groups of related families. Nearly everyone is Muslim.

<h2>Somali Food</h2>
Somali food is a mix of different influences, including Arab, Indian, and Italian flavours. This is because Somalia has always been a busy trading country.
<p> Common foods include rice and pasta, along with meats like lamb, beef, and chicken. Spices such as cumin and cardamom are used a lot. Somali cuisine also features hearty stews, traditional flatbreads like <strong><em>"Canjeero/Lahooh"</em></strong> and tasty pastries.</p>
<p> A special part of Somali food is the use of camel meat and milk. These are considered special treats and are very important in Somali cooking.<br>
  Somali rice, often eaten for lunch or dinner, is usually seasoned and mixed with meat, vegetables, and sometimes even raisins for a sweet touch. It can also be coloured with saffron to look more appealing.
  Pasta and lasagne are also popular, especially in the south. This shows the lasting influence of Italian rule.</p>
<p> Tea and coffee are very popular drinks. Somalis were among the first people to enjoy coffee and were important in the global coffee trade. Somali coffee, called <strong><em>"Qahwo",</em></strong> and tea, <strong><em>"Shah",</em></strong> are special because they are made with a mix of different spices.</p>
<p> After meals, homes are often filled with the smell of frankincense or incense <strong><em>(unsi).</em></strong> This is burned in a special burner called a <strong><em>dabqaad.</em></strong>
